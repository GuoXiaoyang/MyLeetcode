 205. Isomorphic Strings
 Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

 Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

 All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

 For example,
 Given "egg", "add", return true.

 Given "foo", "bar", return false.

 Given "paper", "title", return true.

 Note:
 You may assume both s and t have the same length.
